    Your cars has never been more secure. <br /> <br />
       
    Our tracking system works as follows : <br /> <br />
    
    A GPS box tracks the car, detects its position and indicates if it's moving. <br />
    When you are away from your moving car, the alarm is activated. <br />
    Your position is signaled to the tracking service by an app on your smartphone. <br /> <br />
    
    When the car is moving, the	alarm is activated if the <br />
    position of the owner is unknown or not updated since an hour when the car is movin g. <br />
    It is also possible to define areas in which the alarm is disabled between some time slots.	 <br />
    For	example, the parking lot of the workplace or when arriving at home. <br />
    The	box in the car is just a GPS tracker. <br /> <br />
